# Twitter Sentiment Analytics using Apache Spark Streaming APIs and Python

This project is developed to understand the sentiments of the users on Twitter based on the hashtags. In this project, we processed live data streams of tweets from Twitter using Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Python. Spark was used to fetch live data stream using twitter APIs and Kafka as the queuing service to process the streams of data in queue. To process the data, we have used Python and Natural Lanugage Processing and finally displaying the sentiments in plots(bar chats, pie charts).
